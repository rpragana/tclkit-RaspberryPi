Tclkit for Raspberry Pi
=======================

Here you find two versions of tclkit for the Raspberry Pi microcomputer (Arm). They were generated by kitgen utility. One version is with tclsh only *(tclkit-RPi-8.6-cli)*, the other with tk *(tclkit-RPi-8.6-gui)*. Both uses the most recent tcl/tk versions, 8.6.

You may use them to run any starkit files with script-only extensions or libraries. For compiled extensions (anything that requires a .so or .dll in linux or windows), you will need to compile for the RPi as well).
